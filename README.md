# The AIDS-cure Genocide
This repository will used to gather and distribute intelligence about the The AIDS-cure Genocide started by Gilead Sciences after learning of a abnormal routine viral load test result for a known HIV+ patient, which indicated (and was confirmed by the NIH) he could not possibly have HIV after years of being HIV+.

Gilead Sciences paid the CIA indirectly to execute both the patient and one of the Creator's servants whom the patient had identified, during an intense interrogation after the initial test result, as the person whom had given him something to try.

When the CIA couldn't kill the Creator's servant, they killed everyone he ever knew, or that knew his name or face. The CIA, led by Annie Jacobsen, then launched an attack on the servant's lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky killing everyone in attendance on April 2nd, 2023. 

Today the CIA continues killing everyone affiliated with Mount Calvary Baptist Church, and everyone affiliated with them, in an attempt to cover it up.

(Yes, this is what "Sign of the Times" by Prince is all about. Prince is a cousin of the Creator's servant.)
