We do not know where, the Creator does not ever tell us the future, but an attack is imminent. A Sunday morning worship session is likely.

Using history as a guide, they'll attack nearing the end of worship services. They may amass outside the church just before attacking, or launch the attack from within first posing as a visiting group or congregation. Either way, it will be an all male group.

There may be two different groups, one black and one white. We base this on the number of known individuals who are not at home.

Location of attack is unknown. Conversations with suspected individuals have indicated travel to Charleston, SC. But we cannot rule out Kentucky given all of the activity in the past year.

Given the Charleston and SC intelligence we have, churches around Georgetown, SC should be on heightened alert given Micah's time there. One specific church would be: Maryville Pentecostal Holiness Church in Georgetown, SC.
