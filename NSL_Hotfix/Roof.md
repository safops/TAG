# Roof To Be Exonerated
First, this may anger or confuse some, but Dylan Roof is not guilty of the attack on Mother Emmanuel. According to the Creator, Dylan Roof has done nothing to be jailed for.

Roof was known to the FBI for his separatist views and when the CIA needed an assailant for its manufactured Bible study attack on a "historic black church" the FBI gave them Roof's name in a list of minimum viable suspects. The CIA manufactured a story based on a couple of images they obtained that Roof was photographed in. 

Roof was ultimately selected from the list due to his lack of family and few friends, limited education, no access to the news media, no knowledge of the case, underage possession of a firearm, inability to understand the legal process, no financial ability to hire a lawyer, and in earlier fake interrogations about an unrelated incident he broke down under pressure. 

My curiosity was piqued when I noticed what most would consider a misspelling of Immanuel on the flyer for the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.'s Pastoral Anniversary event. Then I remembered Mother Emmanuel in South Carolina. I checked with the Boss and He confirmed that Dylan Roof had indeed been setup.

Emmanuel Baptist Church in Louisville is another charade setup by the CIA. They are sometimes the "home church" of the traveling choir used to conduct surveillance on targeted congregations. 

More to come...
