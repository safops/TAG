In early May after learning of the massacre from the Creator, He then told me that I needed to do something to stop the CIA from using my church as a base of operations for future murder and domestic terror operations. 

At first try to alert public using social media but my Facebook gotten zero interaction except for a few paid trolls for the CIA, my Twitter got absolutely zero interaction.

The Creator told me again that I needed to do more. 

I decided to write a letter, but by that point, the CIA had rendered all of my mobile and electronic devices inoperable or it's still in them completely. So I went to the local library in the new town that they had moved me to in Riverdale, Georgia. 

Writing the letter from the Riverdale library was very challenging. The hitmen arrived and tried, someone was connected to my VMware Horizons public internet terminal changing the letter as I was writing it, finally I heard someone say, "blitzkrieg."

The Creator told me for the very first and only time to leave a deadly situation, but that I need to walk slow enough so everyone see me walk out. As I exited the library I looked above and seen the first Air Force fighter jet making a pass directly over the library (420 Valley Hill Rd, Riverdale, GA 30274).

I made this tweet just a few moments later. Air traffic controls radar should have it, it wasn't a stealth bomber although they have flown those over my apartment. 

The letter is pretty long and most of it he's worried in another post here detailing the [massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church](https://github.com/safops/TAG/discussions/5). You can read the letter and it's entirety [here](https://github.com/safops/MCBCMassacre/blob/base/assets/pdf/20230506_kew_mcbc_letter.pdf). 

In the letter I listed several complaints I had about the church, it's current state, and a question the identity of Reverend Dr Felix G. Williams, III who is my cousin. With his identity and question I decided to remove him, all the associate pastors, and the Deacons. I Am The only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church I can do that as I constituted a quorum. I did give him the opportunity, if he was the Reverend doctor Felix G Williams III, to submit to a DNA test to prove it. Had he proven it with the DNA test all of them could be returned and I would step aside. 

I installed myself as pastor solely for the purpose of inviting the Commonwealth in to investigate all of our missing members. 

The CIA or someone they appointed responded, I knew instantly from the first paragraph it was not anyone at my Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington Kentucky.

I apologize if I didn't warn you ahead of time does that first paragraph was going to cause you some stomach upset if you've ever been a member of a Christian church. 

You may notice that the responding "church" is now called Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. 

There's two things about that that bother me, we were never Missionary Baptist and we were never incorporated, because we're a church. 

The "missionary" came from the fact that we run missions for the Creator. As soon as we can begin we will start the Creator's mission number 23 for life on Earth. 

The Creator nor His servants found this funny.
