_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is a small church on Todds Road in remote Lexington, Kentucky is the site of the first massacre of an entire congregation inside of a church in US history. The massacre began during Sunday morning worship services on April 2nd, 2023 when everyone in attendance, 127 people were killed. 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of one of the Creator's servants,  Micah. Micah was born, Kelvin Eugene Williams. The pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church is Micah's cousin, the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. 

The massacre was the first massacre of a church's congregation in the [AIDS cure genocide](https://github.com/serviCreator/TAG).

## Location 
Mount Calvary Baptist Church is located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, KY. The church is in a remote area of Lexington with very low traffic and very few, if any, routine police patrols. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. The church’s address conveys urban area, however, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a rural suburb called Pricetown (see [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZgjiHDMm8bGsM2e7?g_st=ic)).  Lexington is unique in that the city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county.

## Anatomy of Attack
Around 1:30am on the morning of the attack, Micah was arrested in Riverdale, Georgia for shoplifting. 

The alleged incident occurred at the Texaco, and while walking back to his apartment, Micah walked past a police officer driving slowly on GA-85. As Micah turned onto Howard St, the officer pulled up behind him and turned on the lights. Micah was questioned, arrested and taken to Clayton County Jail.  Micah had multiple attempts made on his life inside the jail. 

The next morning Micah was awaken and told he was being transported to DeKalb county. A few minutes later he was escorted out of the housing unit. Micah never encountered a single inmate from the jail's general population at anytime during the release process, only CIA personnel posing as inmates and jail employees.  Upon release, Micah was placed in the back of a DeKalb County Sheriff's SUV. 

According to the Creator, Annie Jacobsen arrived at Mount Calvary Baptist Church around 11:45 am. Jacobsen was welcomed in by the ushers and found a seat in the rear of the church. Jacobsen focused mainly on her mobile phone. 

Upon arrival at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Micah asked the transporting deputy if he could use his mobile phone. Micah was concerned about a dog he had, that was locked in a pet carrier in his apartment. 

Micah contacted Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation and asked her if she could help him by caring for the dog while he was incarcerated. Tracy urged him to re-home the dog instead of a temporary shelter, Micah agreed. 

Micah sent out a [tweet](https://twitter.com/kelvinewilliams/status/1642922137051713536?t=9prXB5tMaF_e6iZVsmm0Dg&s=19) hoping someone would see it, and entered the DeKalb County Detention Center and another round of attempts on his life by CIA personnel posing as inmates.

After Thompson received the call from Micah, according to the Creator, she sent a message to Jacobsen advising that Micah was now secured at DeKalb County Detention Center. Jacobsen then sent a message to the supervisor of the group outside. The group made up of approximately fifty men and one woman were dressed in all black, few were actual CIA employees, and almost none knew they would be attacking a church. 

Four men armed with shotguns quietly entered the church through the exterior door of the anteroom outside of the women’s restroom on the northwest corner of the church, two of the men went into the adjoining men’s anteroom. The rear entrances are the lesser used entrances with the women’s anteroom being the one generally used due to the relative  location of the access street and parking lot. 

During services, the doors between the anterooms and the  sanctuary are closed to prevent interruptions from other activities that may be occurring in the rear of the church. 

The group that was waiting outside came from the rear parking lot and gathered outside on the front steps of the church, largely undetected by the congregation. 

![floorplan.png](https://github.com/serviCreator/TAG/assets/155787787/6c64dc8c-53ee-4e5b-9d57-3f260584ef40)

Jacobsen got up from her seat in the sanctuary and went outside and met up with the team gathering in front of the church. Within the sanctuary, congregants noticed men amassing outside the windows on the western side of the church that runs along Pricetown Lane and in front of the church through opened windows. It gave the congregants that seen it the sense that the church was being surrounded, unnerving some. 

Most of the congregation jumped to its feet when they heard the noise from the group gathering in the vestibule. They were alarmed by the number of people in the small room that normally has no more than five or so waiting at any given time, also by the fact that by that point, late in the service, usually no one is trying to enter the sanctuary. 

Jacobsen had obtained a bullhorn outside and announced that she absolutely hated the sermon and that everyone in the church needed to die. 

The individuals who were in the anterooms in the back of the church, opened the doors to the sanctuary with their shotguns at the ready, and the group that had amassed in the vestibule loudly entered the sanctuary. They hurled racial slurs that made the congregation realize that their entrance was not any law enforcement action. After the group's entrance, Jacobsen left the church and went to an area hotel.

Although not a law enforcement action, Micah has learned that some in the group were law enforcement, a few of them were at the scene when Micah was arrested earlier that morning.

Many in the congregation attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered on mobile phones  by CIA personnel in another location on mobile phones, not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government or any other public safety answering point (PSAP).

Several of the CIA's personnel also attempted to call 911 when they realized they were launching an attack on a congregation during their worship services. 

A truck with cellular tower radio equipment, called a Cell On Wheels (or COW), was parked in the rear parking lot. It was powered on shortly after arrival at the church, causing mobile devices up to 1.5 miles away to connect to the mobile tower as they would any new tower today they'd encounter as they move around.  

COWs are deployed and used by mobile network operators to quickly restore service in the event of a catastrophic tower failure. Once deployed and powered up, mobile phones in the area will treat it like any other tower they encounter. Quite simply, if the phone “hears” the tower, it will talk to it. The typical tower covers roughly one-half miles, so when the COW was started mobile phones in the general vicinity treated it like any other tower they would hear along in a typical commute. The COWs were not connected to any cellular network.

Micah, who has spent most of his professional career as an Internet Protocol Engineer with companies like textPlus and 373K specializes in Voice over IP and has worked alongside cellular providers like TMobile, made an professional guess as to what happened to the calls. 

Micah says, “With the phones homed (connected) to the COW, any dialed number would be handled by the COWs onboard radio equipment. What would normally route over the back haul connection or the connection to the cellular networks, they could just hand off to equipment in the truck. You can download software from the web and, for me, it would take less than an hour to configure a softswitch to handle calls made to anything. Spending no money on a terminating carrier just playing a recording is simple, and routing those calls to another number once in the switch would take a couple bucks, a high speed Internet connection and about two more minutes of configuration.” 

Acording to the Creator, the configuration Micah describes is identical to what was used.  All calls to 911 were routed and connected to their personnel’s mobile phones. All other calls were dropped. The Creator tells Micah that they used [Asterisk](https://asterisk.org), the most popular open source softswitch, and [Flowroute](https://flowroute.com) for terminating (completing) calls. 

Micah says, “All they needed was a credit card, they didn’t even need to make a phone call to get that setup. Flowroute would have never known what was going on, it’s just calls to a non-emergency number. From Flowroute’s vantage point, the leg of the call they’re handling, no one has called 911. Over a SIP trunk, they likely wouldn’t have seen that. Just a normal call to a mobile phone number.” 

The call takers were told for the operation to act as true 911 call takers, act as if they were gathering information, say they were sending help, but otherwise ignore the pleas for it. Two out of the seven call takers have worked in PSAPs as 911 call takers, and provided training to the others. 911 callers from within the sanctuary provided address information, a description of the activity inside the church and call back numbers. They were told emergency services were en-route and hung up on—-something rarely done by actual 911 call takers before first responders arrive.  

Inside, the normally peaceful sanctuary became chaotic and terrifying for the congregation almost immediately as the CIA’s personnel acted as instructed.  They raped, pillaged and otherwise terrorized the congregation. Parents did everything to shield their children from the things going on around them. 

In the remote church, far from routine police patrols and while following the orders of Annie Jacobsen the CIA’s personnel began killing. Members of the congregation were taken to the front of the church and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 

The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which is at the front of the church. The baptismal’s water had a formulation added to it which made it chemically cremate the bodies. 

### “Frying Chicken”
The initial operation is referred to by the CIA and others as “Frying Chicken.” The moniker was applied to the operation after the fact because the congregants did fight for their lives. 

## Aftermath 
Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. was formed by the CIA, which then began occupying the church's property. The CIA provided funeral arrangements to loved ones of victims who called the church phone number inquiring about their whereabouts. Friends and family of the victims would then relay details of the arrangements to others. However, on the day of the announced funeral, mourners would arrive at the church only to be killed. Dozens of funerals could be announced at the exact same time. The purpose of the funerals was to eliminate any people who could cause the CIA problems by talking about their loved ones who went missing at church. This cycle  continues to repeat today, with funerals now announced for people who went to the church for a fake funeral instead of the victims of the original massacre. It has no signs of stopping, as each fake funeral grows larger. 

Micah has been working to remove the CIA and [Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church Inc](https://github.com/serviCreator/TAG/discussions/10) from the church’s property. The Creator, nor His servants find the use of “Missionary” in the name comical given it that the massacre stems from the [Creator’s Mission 23 for Life on Earth](https://github.com/orgs/serviCreator/discussions/23).

## Surprise, Kill, Vanish 
The initial massacre was based on tactics written by Jacobsen in her book, _"Surprise, Kill, Vanish."_ A review of the book can be found on the CIA's [website](https://www.cia.gov/static/Review-Surprise-Kill-Vanish.pdf), a copy is stored in our repository and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/blob/base/assets/pdf/20180830_cia_review_surprise_kill_vanish.pdf).

## Confirmation by the CIA 
### Ecclesiastical Clergy Ring
The CIA inadvertently confirmed the murder of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III on two occasions. The first confirmation came when a CIA Officer placed the ecclesiastical clergy ring of the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III beside him in a display of pride and winning at keeping him silenced. Micah put the ring in a safe place and the CIA has tried repeatedly to take it back. 

The ring was given to Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III upon his graduation from seminary and shows how he rarely removed it.

### 40th Pastoral Anniversary 
The second confirmation came when they held a photo shoot at the church that prominently featured models who looked like the slain family members of Micah. 

Micah wrote about the Pastoral Anniversary [in this post](https://github.com/serviCreator/TAG/discussions/31) and  [medium.com](https://medium.com/@theServantsoftheCreator/40th-pastoral-anniversary-9ce004764732).
